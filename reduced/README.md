## Notes on the data

In this file we list problems noticed visually with the default reduction on individual stars, enumerated by Campaign.

### Bad reductions

#### C7 
* omi Sgr - a bit of contamination
* psi Sgr - a lot of contamination

#### C8 
* 60 Psc - didn't correctly threshold saturation
* 80 Psc - contaminating star at top right
* WW Psc - contamination at 4:00 at edge

#### C9
All stars are extremely contaminated - field is very crowded.

#### C10
* HD 107794 - a bit of contamination at 6:00 at the edge
* HR 4613 - a little bit of contamination not far out at 5:00

#### C11
* omi Oph - a bit of contamination at 2:00 a little way out
* tet Oph - bad - all weight falls on a couple of pixels

#### C12 
* 81 Aqr - totally broken

#### C13
* 105 Tau - contamination at 9:00 
* 51 Tau - contamination from several sources
* 56 Tau - contamination at 6:00 at edge
* 75 Tau - contamination at 2:00 far out
* 97 Tau - broken
* 98 Tau - contamination - important because it seems there's a transit! 
* HR 1755 - a bit of contamination at 6:00 at edge
* del3 Tau - a bit of contamination at 6:00 at edge
* kap1 Tau - good signal but odd structure
* rho Tau - bad aperture
* nu Tau - good signal but weights are only on a few pixels

#### C14 
All good! 

#### C15 
* zet4 Lib - bi t of contamination at the edge at 2:00 

#### C16 
* omi2 Cnc - contamination at the edges

#### C17
* HR 5106 - contamination is significant
* Spica - threshold too low

#### C18
* HR 3264 - contamination at edge
* HR 3222 seems suboptimal
