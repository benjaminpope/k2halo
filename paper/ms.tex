\begin{abstract}
While the \kepler\ mission was designed to look at tens of thousands of faint stars ($V \gtrsim 12$), brighter stars which saturate the detector are nevertheless some of the most interesting because of the ease with which they can be observed by other instruments and the wealth of knowledge about them that is already available. By considering the unsaturated scattered light `halo' around these stars we retrieve precise light curves of most of the brightest stars in \ktwo fields from Campaign~4 onwards. This bright star survey reveals stellar variability ubiquitously, including effects of stellar pulsation, rotation, and binarity. Here we describe our pipeline, and present a catalogue of the bright stars studied, with classifications and parametrizations of their variability and remarks on interesting objects. These light curves are publicly available as a High Level Science Product from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). \href{https://github.com/benjaminpope/k2halo}{\color{linkcolor}\faGithub} % git link shamelessly borrowed from Luger!

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}

% intro kepler
The \kepler Space Telescope was launched with a main goal of determining the frequency of Earth-sized planets around Solar-like stars \citep{2010sci...327..977b}, a goal which it has substantially achieved \citep[e.g.][]{2013ApJ...766...81F,2013PNAS..11019273P,2014ApJ...795...64F}. In order to explore these populations it was necessary to observe hundreds of thousands of stars, with the consequence that the \kepler the exposure time and gain were set to optimally observe eleventh or twelfth-magnitude stars, while bright stars are saturated and these saturated stars were intentionally avoided. In the two-wheeled revival as the \ktwo mission, the \kepler telescope observed a sequence of ecliptic-plane fields containing many more very-saturated stars. While it is difficult to obtain precise light curves of these stars because of their saturation, they are some of the most-valuable targets to follow up with photon-hungry methods such as interferometry or high-resolution spectroscopy, and they typically have long histories of previous observations. 

% briefly intro the halo method and halo literature
In order to recover precise photometry of the brightest stars in \ktwo, we have developed two main approaches, `smear' and `halo' photometry. Smear photometry \citep{Pope2016} uses collateral calibration data to recover light curves of stars which were not necessarily conventionally targeted. The more precise method of halo photometry, which is the subject of this paper, uses the broad `halo' of scattered light around a saturated star to recover relative photometry, by constructing a light curve as a linear combination of individual pixel time series and minimizing a Total Variation objective function (TV-min). It has been employed for example on the Pleiades \citep{White2017} and the brightest-ever star on \kepler silicon, Aldebaran \citep{Farr2018}, recovering photometry with a precision nearly that of normally-obtained \ktwo observations of unsaturated stars. Unlike smear, this requires downloading data out to a 12--20~pixel radius around each star, and has accordingly only been possible for stars that were specifically targeted with apertures optimized for this method and for a small number of other stars for which this is fortuitously the case.

% describe contents of paper: code, catalog, categorization, conclusions
In this Paper we describe the complete catalog of long-cadence \ktwo halo light curves which we have made publicly available. We have employed halo photometry on all stars targeted with appropriate apertures, and have done a preliminary characterization of interesting astrophysical variability. We also document the main changes in the halo data reduction pipeline, \texttt{halophot}, with respect to previous releases. These include oscillating red giants, pulsating and quiet main sequence stars, and eclipsing binaries, many of which are among the brightest objects of their type to have been observed with space photometry. We hope that this diverse catalog of light curves will be useful for an equally-diverse range of astrophysical investigations. 

\section{Halo Photometry Method}
\label{method}

% describe saturation
The \kepler detector saturates at a magnitude of $K_p \sim 11.3$ in both long- (30\,min) and short (1\,min)-cadence data, as these both represent sums of 6~s exposures \citep{Gilliland2010}. Beyond this point, additional photons cause excess electrons to `bleed' into adjacent pixels in both directions along the column containing the bright star. This process occurs conservatively and simple aperture photometry (SAP) adding all the flux contained in a window around the bleed column has recovered light curves with precisions close to the photon noise limit of stars as bright as 16~Cyg~AB, $\theta$~Cyg and RR~Lyr \citep[e.g.][]{Kolenberg2011,2013MNRAS.433.1262W,Guzik2016}. In the nominal \kepler mission this was not attempted for all such bright stars, and in \ktwo, the several-pixel spacecraft motion significantly increased the size of the required apertures for SAP photometry of very saturated stars, while also making their systematics more difficult to deal with. While the second-version pixel-level-decorrelation (PLD) pipeline EVEREST~2.0 was able to correct systematics in saturated SAP photometry \citep{everest2}, this is rendered impossible for the very brightest stars whose bleed columns may run to the edge of the detector. Furthermore, bandwidth constraints meant that pixel data were not downloaded for many bright targets in \ktwo. It was therefore necessary to develop a method to recover good light curves from a smaller number of unsaturated pixels in a compact aperture around bright stars: halo photometry.

% describe halo algorithm
This method was first described by \citet{White2017} and applied to the Pleiades' Seven Sisters, and was applied to Aldebaran with further developments by \citet{Farr2018}. Because SAP is not possible, we consider instead the unsaturated pixels $p_j$ at the wings of the broad and structured PSF. We construct a light curve as a linear combination of these time series with weights $w_j$, so that flux at cadence $i$ is 

\begin{equation}
    f_i \equiv \sum_j {w_j p_{ij}}.
\end{equation}

\noindent In our updated pipeline presented here, the weights are chosen to minimize an objective function

\begin{equation}
    \Lambda_{k,l} \equiv {\sum_i{|f_i - f_{i-l}|^k}},
\end{equation}

\noindent subject to th the constraints 

\begin{align}
\forall_j w_j &> 0\\
\sum_i f_i  &= N
\end{align}

$\Lambda_{k,l}$ is the $L_k$ norm on a `lagged' finite difference with a lag parameter $l$. For $k = 1$ and $l = 1$, $\Lambda_{1,1}$ is the standard Total Variation objective (TV) used in previous halo papers, and can be seen as the L1 norm on the derivative of $f$ or as a discrete approximation to its arc length. The $L=2$ L2 Variation (L2V) is sometimes referred to in image processing literature as the `smoothness' regularizer, as it seeks to penalize large gradients without necessarily making them sparse. The lag parameter $l$ allows for flexibility in modelling systematics occurring at different timescales from cadence-to-cadence, and we investigate its effects below. The order parameter $k$ allows for flexibility in how sensitive we are to normally-distributed versus long-tailed noise. TV with any lag is a convex objective function and $\Lambda_{k,l}$ has analytic derivatives with respect to $w_j$ \citep[calculated with \texttt{autograd}][]{autograd}, and it is therefore extremely fast to optimize and converges well on a global solution.

% smear
This method differs from smear photometry \citep{Pope2016}, which uses collateral `smear' data to obtain a 1-D spatial profile with $\sim 1/1000$ of the flux on each CCD. While this has also been used for photometry of very bright stars, the `halo' method has the advantage of averaging over many more realizations of the K2 pointing systematics and permitting more significant calibration, achieving a generally higher photometric prevision.

% benchmarking with lags and objective functions

In order to choose the objective function $\Lambda_{k,l}$, we have selected the quiet star 36~Ophiuchi, the lowest-mass main sequence star in the halo sample and one with very little high frequency variability detected or predicted, which was also observed at short cadence. We choose the 6.5~hour Combined Differential Photometric Precision \citep[CDPP,][]{cdpp} as implemented in \texttt{lightkurve} \citep{lightkurve} as a proxy for the `noise' in a lightcurve, with lower being better. We calculate halo lightcurves and their CDPPs for $k \in \{1,2,3\}$, and $l \in [1,50]$ for long cadence and (sparsely) $l \in [1,2500]$ for short cadence data. The results are displayed in Figure~\ref{cdpps}. We find that for long cadence data, the L1 norm (TV) and a lag of 10 provide the best CDPP, which is unsurprising given that this is a slightly shorter lag than the 12~cadence thruster firing period. In this context we can understand the optimum as TV-min suppressing systematics on the same timescale as they occur. On the other hand, for short cadence data, performance at short lags is very poor but the method performs similarly for $k \in \{1,2\}$ and improves very slowly with $l$ for longer lags, and performs very poorly for $k=3$ at all lags. 

\begin{figure*}
\plottwo{lag_lc_cdpp.pdf}{lag_sc.pdf}
\caption{Behaviour of long cadence (left) and short cadence (right) 6.5~hour CDPP for the quiet dwarf 36~Ophiuchi as a function of lag parameter $l$. For long cadence this shows a minimum for L1 norm and $l=10$, i.e. for objective function $\Lambda_{1,10}$. For short cadence CDPP continuously improves for higher lags and shows no strong differences between L1 and L2~norms, while L3 performs poorly.}
\label{cdpps}
\end{figure*}

% describe changes with respect to Pleiades and Aldebaran papers: deathstar

In addition to these changes in objective function, we have also added a feature `\texttt{deathstar}' to deal with contamination. We apply the watershed-based image segmentation algorithm from \textsc{k2p2} \citep{k2p2} to the input target pixel file datacube to identify possible background sources and cut them out. \textcolor{red}{More here from Tim.} Other than this, we have adopted less-aggressive quality flagging, having found that many cadences were being classified as bad quality for spurious `cosmic ray' events, which were actually caused by a combination of saturation and spacecraft motion. We now iteratively sigma-clip outliers and retain cadences with the \texttt{lightkurve} default quality mask.

% incorporation of k2sc
While the halo procedure produces in most cases a fairly clean light curve, there are nevertheless residual systematic errors related to spacecraft motion. In order to correct these, we employ the \textsc{k2sc} code \citep{Aigrain2015,k2sc}, which simultaneously models a light curve as a 3D Gaussian Process (GP) in time and predicted position (the K2 standard data product \textsc{pos\_corr}) in pixels $(x,y)$. The model prediction in time for fixed position is then a nonparametric model of the stellar variability, and the prediction for the $x,y$ component evaluated for fixed time represents the pointing systematics. We subtract the systmatics model from the input fluxes to obtain a final corrected flux, which is the time series we use and recommend for science. The target pixel files for C91, C92, and C101 include no position information, and there are no halo apertures for C112. As a result \textsc{k2sc}-corrected data are not available for these targets.

\section{Sample}
\label{sec:sample}

% link to tables 

The full sample of stars for which halo apertures were obtained is listed in Tables~\ref{table_0}--\ref{table_5}, broken down by Campaign. While some very bright stars were observed with conventional apertures as part of these programs, simple aperture photometry is satisfactory on these targets and we exclude them from the present discussion and data release, which is oriented strictly towards targets only observable with halo photometry. 
% normal apertures in 6
We make an exception for Spica, which was observed in Campaign~6 without a halo aperture but in Campaign~17 with a halo aperture. In Campaign~6 it was assigned a normal aperture by mistake and simple aperture photometry performed extremely poorly, so we have processed it with the halo pipeline. The stars in Campaign~18 were also on-silicon in Campaign~5, but were not assigned apertures suitable for halo photometry in C5. A possible further extension of the present work would be to recover C5 light curves for these objects using either or both of smear or modified halo photometry.

% short cadence availability 
Seven stars in Campaign~13 and one in Campaign~16 were not only assigned long-cadence halo apertures, but also downloaded at short cadence. For these targets we have provided both long and short cadence reductions. Following the analysis in Section~\ref{method} showing the insensitivity of short cadence CDPP to lags longer than $\sim 100$~cad and on choice of objective function, for consistency with long cadence we have adopted a 300~cadence lag (i.e. $30 \times$ the long cadence lag of 10) and the L1 TV objective function. With their long timeseries the short cadence stars are computationally intractable for the Gaussian Process model in \textsc{k2sc} and we present otherwise uncalibrated halo lightcurves.

% breakdown of main sequence vs giants

% note interesting targets: Aldebaran; Spica; Hyades; rho Leo

Analyses for several of the objects here have been previously published, but we here provide the first public data releases for the Pleiades' Seven Sisters \citep{White2017}, Aldebaran \citep{Farr2018}, $\iota$~Lib \citep{Buysschaert2018}, and $\epsilon$~Tau \citep{Arentoft2019}, as well as $\rho$~Leo which was studied with halo pixels but without our objective functions \citep{Aerts2018}.

% interesting EB - 98 Tau
The chemically-peculiar A0V star 98~Tau is of special interest for studies of surface inhomogeneity. We detect variability with a fundamental period of 1.74~d with twice as much power at the first harmonic ($P = 0.87$\,d), which is consistent with $\alpha^2$\,CVn spot modulation from a rapidly-rotating star with a period of 1.74\,d. This star also experiences a transit of depth 0.03, which for a 1.87\,\rsun typical A0V star imply an 0.3 \rsun companion, almost certainly of stellar mass. With rotational modulation and an eclipse to break degeneracies, models such as \texttt{starry} \citep{starry} can infer surface brightness maps and reveal the spatial distribution of the star's chemical peculiarity. 

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

% pretty good sample

% do hot star asteroseismology and red giants as benchmarks, interferometry
Some of the objects presented here are the subject of more detailed work in preparation, namely Spica (Buzasi et al., in prep.) and the Hyades giants (White et al., in prep.). In addition to this, we aim to separately publish asteroseismic catalogues of the red giants (Yu et al., in prep.) and main-sequence stars (Greklek-McKeon et al., in prep.). 

% do k2 smear after that
The sample of K2 bright stars presented here only includes those with halo apertures, but while some others are available conventionally, many were not assigned target pixels and were not downloaded at all. Smear photometry has been used to recover the brightest otherwise-unobserved stars in nominal \kepler (Pope et al., in prep.), and this can also be done in K2, although in the latter case the sample is much smaller due to competition with halo apertures and the systematics correction is more difficult. A natural extension of both pieces of work would be to produce smear light curves of all bright stars without halo apertures in K2, which would finally make the \kepler extended mission magnitude-complete at the bright end. 

% tess halo 
The halo method naturally extends to other contexts where simple aperture photometry is not possible, such as for saturated stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \citep[TESS;][]{tess}. Although the saturation limit is brighter ($T_{mag} \sim 6$) and this problem accordingly affects fewer stars and less badly, there are situations such as for $\alpha$~Centauri or $\beta$~Hydri where the bleed column reaches the edge of the chip and a SAP light curve is irrecoverable. We expect that TV-min halo photometry will therefore be valuable in ensuring that TESS can observe even the very brightest stars.
