%% Modified 2018 January

%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.2 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style  which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%%
%% using aastex version 6.2
\documentclass[modern]{aastex62}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be envoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[argument]{aastex62}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Preferred style for Research Notes which are by design 
%%                lacking an abstract and brief. DO NOT use \begin{abstract}
%%                and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can envoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%  astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%  tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                 the twocolumn substyle.
%%  times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%  linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%  trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%  longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                 the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                 affiliation information after each name. Creates a much
%%                 long author list but may be desirable for short author papers
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex62}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%%\hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.

%% Note that the \and command from previous versions of AASTeX is now
%% depreciated in this version as it is no longer necessary. AASTeX 
%% automatically takes care of all commas and "and"s between authors names.

%% AASTeX 6.2 has the new \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands to
%% provide the collaboration status of a group of authors. These commands 
%% can be used either before or after the list of corresponding authors. The
%% argument for \collaboration is the collaboration identifier. Authors are
%% encouraged to surround collaboration identifiers with ()s. The 
%% \nocollaboration command takes no argument and exists to indicate that
%% the nearby authors are not part of surrounding collaborations.

%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. 
\begin{abstract}
While the \kepler\ mission was designed to look at tens of thousands of faint stars ($V \gtrsim 12$), brighter stars which saturate the detector are nevertheless some of the most interesting because of the ease with which they can be observed by other instruments and the wealth of knowledge about them that is already available. By considering the unsaturated scattered light `halo' around these stars we retrieve precise light curves of most of the brightest stars in \ktwo fields from Campaign 6 onwards. This halo campaign reveals stellar variability ubiquitously, including effects of stellar pulsation, rotation, and binarity. Here we describe our pipeline, and present a catalogue of the halo sources, with classifications and parametrizations of their variability and remarks on interesting objects. These light curves are publicly available as a High Level Science Product. \href{https://github.com/benjaminpope/k2halo}{\color{linkcolor}\faGithub} % shamelessly borrowed from Luger!

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}

% intro kepler

% briefly intro the halo method and halo literature

% describe contents of paper: code, catalog, categorization, conclusions

\section{Halo Photometry}
\label{sec:k2}

% describe saturation, smear

% describe TV-min algorithm

% describe changes with respect to Pleiades and Aldebaran papers: deathstar

% incorporation of k2sc

% figure 

\section{Sample}
\label{sec:sample}

% link to tables 
% normal apertures in 6

The full sample of stars for which halo apertures were obtained is listed in Tables~\ref{table_0}--\ref{table_5}, broken down by Campaign. While some very bright stars were observed with conventional apertures as part of these programs, simple aperture photometry is satisfactory on these targets and we exclude them from the present discussion and data release, which is oriented strictly towards targets only observable with halo photometry. We make an exception for Spica, which was observed in Campaign~6 without a halo aperture but in Campaign~17 with a halo aperture. In Campaign~6 it was assigned a normal aperture by mistake and simple aperture photometry performed extremely poorly, so we have processed it with the halo pipeline.

% short cadence availability 

% breakdown of main sequence vs giants

% note interesting targets: Aldebaran; Spica; Hyades; rho Leo

Some of the objects here have been previously published, but we here provide the first public data releases for the Pleiades' Seven Sisters \citep{White2017}, Aldebaran \citep{Farr2018}, $\iota$~Lib \citep{Buysschaert2018}, and $\epsilon$~Tau \citep{arentoft2019}. 


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

% how well did we do?

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

% pretty good sample

% do hot star asteroseismology and red giants as benchmarks, interferometry
Some of the objects presented here are the subject of more detailed work in preparation, namely Spica (Buzasi et al., in prep.) and the Hyades giants (White et al., in prep.). In addition to this, we aim to separately publish asteroseismic catalogues of the red giants (Yu et al., in prep.) and main-sequence stars (Greklek-McKeon et al., in prep.). 


% do k2 smear after that

% tess halo
